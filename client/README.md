# Mean Finance Client

This is a simple Typescript client to make it easier to interact with Mean Finance's server.

## Testing

Jest is used to write and run tests. You might need to be running the server in order to test the client properly.

You can do `npm run test` to run the tests. Any file in the [test](test) folder that ends with `.spec.ts` will be considered for testing. If you need to add tests, you can add them following that convention.
